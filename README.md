<i> 
General idea: Cortical columns form a convolutional structure which encodes sounds in 3 steps <br>
'1' 'Core': pitch, <br>
'2' 'Belt': inflection (change over short timescales), <br>
'3' 'Parabelt': codon units - like phonemes which are then recombined in higher areas <br>

x) the codons link into Wernickes area, where they are recombined to form words from proto-syllables
